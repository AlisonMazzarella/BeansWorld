Simple interactive game catching falling objects - through the eyes of my dog 

Programming doesn't have to be complicated. Sometimes writing something that's fun can also be educational. 

To play the game click run, to quit the game hit "q" on your keyboard. When the game begins move your mouse or laptop trackpad to interact with the falling objects.
This game is an ode to my dog and his favorite, and least favorite things. 
Catch the birds, or eat a treat and you will gain points. 
Get pricked by the shot, or touch the leash and you will lose points. 
There is a score tracker however you end the game when you want to - there are no winners or losers. 

Most importantly, HAVE FUN!

The main programming language used is Python, with the Arcade extension library.

# Future Work
* I would love to add more levels where the objects increase in speed.
* It would be fun if the background image ran on an infinite loop. 
* More sounds are always fun for example, if the shot touched you the dog could bark.
